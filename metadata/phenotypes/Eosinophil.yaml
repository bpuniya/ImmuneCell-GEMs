cell_type: Eosinophil
tests:
  hypoxia_glycolytic_shift:
    expected:
      lactate_secretion: increase
      o2_uptake: decrease
    rationale: "Hypoxia shifts energy production toward glycolysis and lactate secretion."
  glucose_limitation:
    expected:
      lactate_secretion: decrease
    rationale: "Lower glucose reduces glycolytic throughput and lactate production."
  butyrate_uptake:
    expected:
      biomass_or_atp: variable
    rationale: "SCFAs can alter effector function/survival; direction may depend on model context."
